# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier in C++

This project is a custom implementation of a Decision Tree classifier built entirely in C++ from scratch — without relying on external ML libraries. It demonstrates an in-depth understanding of decision tree algorithms and how classification works under the hood.

---

## 🧠 Overview

- Built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict categorical outcomes.
- Implemented core concepts such as:
  - **Information Gain**
  - **Gini Impurity**
  - **Recursive Tree Construction**
  - **Prediction Traversal**
- The classifier is capable of handling basic datasets and can be extended for more advanced use cases.

## 📁 Features

- **No External Libraries**: Everything is implemented in pure C++.
- **Readable and Modular Code**: Classes and functions are organized for clarity and maintainability.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Accepts CSV files or hardcoded input for training and prediction.
- **Flexible Splitting Criteria**: Choose between Gini Index or Entropy for decision-making.
